# Automated_Testing
Automated testing is the process of using software tools and scripts to execute predefined tests on  an application or system, allowing for efficient and systematic verification of its functionality and  performance. 


AI application development, automated testing is essential for ensuring that AI
models work reliably and accurately. By automating tests throughout the development process, 
developers can quickly identify and fix any issues or errors in their AI systems. This helps to improve 
the overall quality and trustworthiness of the applications, making them more dependable in realworld use.

We will use Pytest package https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/ for testing. 
Installation: pip install pytest

Task:
 
Part 1: Unit Testing
A. validate_input: applies restrictions in the code (removing symbols and limiting the input 
characters to 200 characters)
B. tokenize_input: ensures that the length of the generated tokens is as expected (e.g., a 
sentence of 10 words is being tokenized to 30 tokens). 

Part 2: Behavioral Testing
